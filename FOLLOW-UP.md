### Q) Any other comments we should read before evaluating your solution?

Nothing to read.

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

If I had more time, I would have added details page of a particular currency. And also the real time graph of the market demand (bids) vs sells volume and prices.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I am not proud of any thing. It was just another challenge/project. But, to be honest I accepted this challenge because it was a bit new for me (working with crypto exchange and order book API). I am proud of that I understood the problem well, read the docs and implemented the required fatures.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

Understanding order book's working principle took most of the time. It wasn't that difficult though.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

I loved the test, to be honest I accepted this challenge because it was a bit new for me (working with crypto exchange and order book API) and the challenge was well documented. It was not very algorithmic or hard, it was good. As I am an intermediate dev, it was in my doable list, didn't get stuck.

I was expecting some pre defined unit tests with jest or chai-mocha, would be very useful for self evaluation if added.
